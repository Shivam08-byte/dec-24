    Divide and Conquer
        Divide and Conquer (D&C) is an algorithmic technique where a problem is divided into smaller subproblems, each of which is solved recursively, and their solutions are combined to solve the original problem.
        Steps:
        Divide: Break the problem into smaller subproblems.
        Conquer: Solve the subproblems recursively. If small enough, solve directly.
        Combine: Merge the subproblem solutions to form the final solution.

        **smaller problems are those which can be solved in one or two operations
